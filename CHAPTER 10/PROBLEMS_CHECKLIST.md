## Notes About the Sample Size Problems (10.42-10.46)

These problems are about a **different study** (cholesterol-lowering drug), not the HORMONE.DAT dataset. They are also implemented but require you to input specific values from your textbook.

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Implemented with placeholder values
**Action needed:** Update p1_ideal and p2_ideal if you want accurate results for these problems

But **Problems 10.37-10.41 are 100% complete and ready to render!**
